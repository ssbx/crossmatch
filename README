This has been tested on debian linux using g++.


This is version 1.1 which fixes a bug when calculating
the cos dec correction for the RA bounds near the poles.
Previously was getting a domain error on trig functions
when the search radius pushes the dec location beyond 
the pole. The result used to be a "nAn" (not a number)
and so a potential match was not being found.

The fix is in method computeRACorrection in the Object class.


Have also included an example to perform a fixed radius
cross match.
